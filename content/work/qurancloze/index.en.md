**QuranCloze** is an Anki deck I created containing all 604 pages of The Noble Quran, designed in a way that simplifies the process of creating cloze deletion flashcards and studying them. With this deck, you can easily create cloze deletion flashcards for any text of the Quran you struggle to memorize.

> **Note:** Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard application that helps with long-term memorization.

## Features

- The deck initially contains 604 notes corresponding to each Quran page, but no cards are created by default (i.e. no actual questions). Users select text they want to study and click the `[...]` button to generate new cloze deletion cards.

- After answering a question, several previous and following pages appear in the back of the card so that the user can review the context of current question if they need.

- Visual enhancements include discrimination between right and left pages to aid visual memory, with full dark mode support.

- The deck is organized using tags for both Surahs and Juz's, making it easy to focus on specific sections.

## Key Benefits

- Covers all 604 Quran pages

- Customizable - create cards only for verses you need

- Visual memory aids (right/left page distinction)

- Context-aware review system

## Technologies Used

I built the QuranCloze deck with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive card interface. A custom cloze deletion card type is created, which allows users to hide selected text portions for active recall testing.
